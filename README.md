Gotta Drik'Em All

## Description

**PokEhólic** is a web application that creatively combines the world of Pokémon with cocktail crafting, providing a fun, interactive way to explore both. This project was born out of a desire to integrate two distinct interests in a unique digital experience, solving the problem of engaging users in learning about cocktails through Pokémon-themed interactions.

- **Motivation**: The project was motivated by the challenge of merging the appeal of Pokémon with the art of mixology in an educational and entertaining format.
- **Why**: This project was developed to create a playful yet informative platform for Pokémon and cocktail enthusiasts alike.
- **Problem it Solves**: It offers a unique approach to learning about different cocktails inspired by the characteristics of various Pokémon.
- **What I Learned**: Through this project, I learned about API integration, responsive web design, and advanced JavaScript techniques for dynamic content management.
